\title{Converts LaTeX to a \code{\link{plotmath}} expression.}
\usage{
TeX(
  input,
  bold = FALSE,
  italic = FALSE,
  user_defined = list(),
  output = c("expression", "character", "ast")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A character vector containing LaTeX strings. 
Note that any backslashes must be escaped (e.g. "$\\alpha").}

\item{bold}{Whether to make the entire label bold}

\item{italic}{Whether to make the entire label italic}

\item{user_defined}{Described in the "Adding New Commands" section.}

\item{output}{The returned object, one of "expression" (default, returns 
a plotmath expression ready for plotting), 
"character" (returns the expression as a string), 
and "ast" (returns the tree used to generate the expression).}
}
\value{
Returns a plotmath expression by default. The \code{output} parameter
can modify the type of the returned value. 

If more than one string is specified in the \code{input} parameter, returns a
list of expressions.
}
\description{
\code{TeX} converts a string comprising LaTeX commands (such as
a math equation) to a \code{\link{plotmath}} expression. Plotmath
expressions can be used throught R's graphic system to represent
formatted text and equations.
}
\section{Adding new commands}{
 
New LaTeX commands can be defined by supplying the \code{user_defined}
parameter. The \code{user_defined} parameter is a list that contains LaTeX
commands as names, and template strings as values. A LaTeX command that
matches one of the names is translated into the corresponding string and
included in the final plotmath expression. The file \code{symbols.R} in the
source code of this package contains one such table that can be used as a
reference.

The template string can include one of the following special template
parameters:

\itemize{
\item \code{$arg1, $arg2, ...} represent the first, second, ... brace
  argument. E.g. for \code{\\frac{x}{y}}, \code{$arg1} is \code{x} and
  \code{$arg2} is \code{y}.
\item \code{$opt} is an optional argument in square brackets. E.g. for
  \code{\\sqrt[2]{x}}, \code{$opt} is \code{2}.
\item \code{$sub} and \code{$sup} are arguments in the exponent (\code{^}) or
  subscript (\code{_}) following the current expression. E.g. for
  \code{\\sum^{x}}, \code{$sup} is \code{x}.
\item \code{$LEFT} and \code{$RIGHT} are substituted the previous and
  following LaTeX expression relative to the current token.
}
See the Examples section for an example of using the \code{user_defined}
option.

\examples{
TeX("$\\\\alpha$") # plots the greek alpha character
TeX("The ratio of 1 and 2 is $\\\\frac{1}{2}$")

a <- 1:100
plot(a, a^2, xlab = TeX("$\\\\alpha$"), ylab = TeX("$\\\\alpha^2$"))

# create a \\variance command that takes a single argument
TeX("$\\\\variance{X} = 10$",
    user_defined = list("\\\\variance" = "sigma[$arg1]^2"))
